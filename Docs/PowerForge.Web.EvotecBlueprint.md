# PowerForge.Web Evotec Website Blueprint

Last updated: 2026-02-18

## Scope
Build a new `evotec.xyz` experience (fresh design) with 30+ projects, per-project docs/API surfaces, blog + news streams, localized domains, and backward-compatible legacy URLs.

## What Engine Already Supports
- Multi-collection websites (`pages`, `docs`, `blog`, `news`, custom collections).
- C# and PowerShell API docs generation, including coverage/xref outputs.
- Search index + shards (language + collection).
- Localization with hreflang/x-default and per-language base URLs.
- Sitemap XML/JSON/HTML generation.
- Redirect generation for Netlify/Azure/Vercel/Apache/Nginx/IIS.
- Navigation profiles/regions/surfaces for route-aware menus.
- Verify/Audit baselines and CI fail-on-new policies.

## Gaps To Close Before Evotec Build
- Add a first-class "project hub" starter pattern in docs/scaffold (data + templates + cards + filters).
- Add a reference theme contract profile for multi-product IA (home/products/project/docs/api/blog/news/contact).
- Add migration helper docs for WordPress-style legacy URL maps (CSV/JSON -> redirects + aliases).
- Optional: add per-language content completeness report (missing translation keys/pages).

## Proposed Information Architecture
- `/` Home (company + value proposition + featured projects + latest blog/news).
- `/offer/` Services (outsourcing/consulting/integrations/audits/etc).
- `/products/` Product catalog (filter by stack: PowerShell/.NET/CLI/Web/Infra).
- `/products/<slug>/` Product landing page with tabs/sections:
  - overview
  - quick start
  - docs
  - API (.NET / PowerShell)
  - changelog
  - links (GitHub/NuGet/PSGallery)
- `/docs/` cross-project docs portal (or project-scoped docs surfaces).
- `/api/` API portal index (project + language facets).
- `/blog/` technical/editorial posts.
- `/news/` company updates/releases.
- `/contact/` contact info + map embed + legal/company data.

## Localization Strategy
- Use localization config with language-specific base URLs.
- Primary domains:
  - `https://evotec.xyz` (default language)
  - `https://evotec.pl` (Polish)
- Optional additional language prefixes/domains later (e.g. French).
- For missing translations:
  - keep page unpublished in target language, or
  - publish with explicit fallback label and canonical to source language only when intentional.

## SEO + Indexing Rules
- Canonical should always point to the final public URL (no staging domains).
- Sitemap should include only indexable pages.
- Keep utility/noindex pages out of XML sitemap.
- Emit hreflang + x-default across localized page sets.
- Keep stable 301 redirects for all legacy URLs.
- Prefer slash-routes as canonical, keep `.html` aliases redirected.

## Legacy URL/Content Migration
- Export old URL inventory (WordPress + manually linked pages).
- Build `redirects` map with source, target, status.
- Add aliases in front matter for high-value posts.
- Validate with audit required routes + link checks.
- Keep migration report artifact in CI.

## Deployment Model (Ubuntu + Apache)
- Build on Ubuntu host (cron/systemd or CI runner).
- Publish static output to Apache vhost root.
- Deploy Apache redirect artifact generated by PowerForge.
- Run post-deploy Cloudflare purge + cache warmup for key routes.

## Recommended Execution Phases
1. Engine hardening + starter contracts (project hub + migration docs).
2. Content inventory + URL migration map.
3. IA/theme implementation (fresh design, mobile-first).
4. Project onboarding in batches (top 10, then long tail).
5. Localization pass and translation completeness checks.
6. SEO stabilization (sitemaps, redirects, GSC validation cycles).
