short_description: Deterministic .NET repository build/release with one Build-Project entrypoint, project.build.json, and explicit GitHub tag policy.
default_prompt: >-
  Build and publish a multi-project .NET repository with Invoke-ProjectBuild.
  Standardize to a single Build/Build-Project.ps1 entrypoint and Build/project.build.json.
  Remove stale wrapper scripts unless explicitly required. Validate discovery/versioning first,
  run plan mode, then execute pack/sign/publish.
  Configure GitHub release mode, primary project, tag template tokens, and tag conflict
  policy explicitly. Ensure output assets and release metadata match plan.
